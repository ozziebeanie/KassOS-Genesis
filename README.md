# KassOS

KassOS is currently a kernel written in x86 Assembly that was designed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525. The new testing device is a HP Probook 6570b. This "Operating System" is a heavly WIP.  By the end of 2025, the plan is to have a fully functional Operating System with a fully custom Bootloader.

# Hardware and Virtualiztion 

KassOS was originally developed to run on a Dell Inspiron 1525 with an Intel Core2Duo. The current device of choice is a HP ProBook 6570b, so if you want the creators experince I suggest you get one. If you want to run KassOS inside a VM, I suggest you use QEMU as it's given the best results.
